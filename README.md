# Cybersecurity-Capstone-Breach-Response-Case-Studies
The following project was a thorough case study on data breaches as part of my specialization course. I will need to select a company that has experienced a data breach. I was required to include information about the characteristics of the attack as well as details about the specific data breach.
However, can use an existing attack methodology and summarize the attack within your project.
My submission topic was a "Case study of the 2021 Microsoft Exchange Server Data Breach"
And it was peer-reviewed accordingly.
